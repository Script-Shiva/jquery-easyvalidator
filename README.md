jquery-easyvalidator
====================

This jQuery plugin makes simple clientside form validation easy, while still offering plenty of customization options. It makes a good choice if you are trying to build something new from scratch, but also when you are trying to integrate something into an existing application with lots of existing markup. The plugin comes bundled with a useful set of validation methods, including URL and email validation, while providing an API to write your own methods. All bundled methods come with default error messages in english and translations into 7 other languages will soon be introduced.

If you want to support the development of this plugin, you are welcome.

The plugin is written and maintained by Shiva Kumar Avula, lead developer of TekIntelligence (Jaffna Software) on the jQuery UI team, PHP and maintainer of Axloid. This plugin is started very recently, and will be updated and improved over time.
